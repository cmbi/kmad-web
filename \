          I counted gaps and gap characters in 120 alignments of proteins from Disprot (a total of
          26881 sequences).
          In the gap count each segment of gap characters was counted as a
          single gap., So, for example sequence 'A--A-A' has two gaps, but
          three gap characters.
          Terminal gaps were not included.
          <br>
          <strong>Gap characters</strong>
          <br>
          In 63 cases KMAD alignment had more gap characters than Clustal
          Omega, while Clustal had more gap characters in 23 cases.
          In 34 cases there was a tie.
          Mean number of gaps in KMAD alignments: 4430.10
          Mean number of gaps in Clustal alignments: 3829.40
          <br>
          <img src="{{ url_for('static',
          filename='images/reviewer_comments/plot_nonterm_chars.png')}}">

          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Gaps</strong>
          In case of gap count the tendency was opposite than with gap
          characters count - KMAD alignment had more often fewer gaps than
          Clustal alignments. In 35 cases KMAD alignments had more gaps, in 59
          cases Clustal alignments had more gaps, and there was a tie in 26
          cases.
          Mean number of gaps in KMAD alignments: 344.88
          Mean number of gaps in Clustal alignments: 392.24
          <br>
          <img src="{{ url_for('static',
          filename='images/reviewer_comments/plot_nonterm_gaps.png')}}">
          
          Such a result is caused by the fact that Clustal alignments more
          often have long terminal gaps, which are later changed by KMAD to
          non-terminal gaps - this causes a large increase in the gap character
          count, but not in the gap count - removing one terminal gap can be
          give hundreds of points to the gap character count, while it will
          only change the gap count by one point. KMAD tends to insert less
          gaps in general, therefore the gap count is lower.
