      The following Clustal alignment has multiple alignment errors, with three
      of them concerning alignment of features.
      First, the two serines on positions 74 and 75 in sequence 1 should be shifted by one position
      to the right to be aligned with the two columns of conserved
      phosphorylated serines. Second, it would probably be more meaningful to
      move the serine from position 94 in the first sequence 2 residues to the
      left. Finally, the N-glycosylated asparagines on position 105 in the
      first 3 sequences and on position 102 in the other two sequences should
      be all lined up. All of these problems are solved in the KMAD alignment.
      Moreover, there are at least two errors not related to
      the features which are solved by the optimization that KMAD performs
      after the alignment:
      <br>
      - glutamate on position 117 in sequence 3 - the alignment score would be
      higher if it was placed at the right side of the gap (postion 118)
      <br>
      - glutamate on position 158 in sequence 4 - moving it to position 157
      also increases the alignment score
