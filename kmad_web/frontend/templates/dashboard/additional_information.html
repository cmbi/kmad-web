        We chose 5 popular alignment methods, i.e. MUSCLE, MAFFT, T-Coffee,
        ClustalW, and Clustal Omega for the comparison. For each of the methods we refined its alignments with KMAD.
        In all cases, except for T-Coffee, KMAD improves the alignment score (both the
        general one and the motif score).
        T-Coffee gets the best scores, but we have to keep in mind that still - these
        proteins are mostly structured. After visual inspection of T-Coffee alignments
        of completely disordered proteins, we conclude that Clustal coupled with KMAD
        very often produces better alignments. (Examples of T-Coffee mistakes are
        presented

      To the 1st reviewer's comment ("What is more, in the provided example,
      all the proteins have names (RLA) that indicate that they belong to the
      same gene family. It would be more convincing if they provided an
      alignment of proteins that diverged more and this method perhaps could
      help the discovery of new members of a protein family.")

      This is a problem for two reasons. First of all for many proteins from
      Disprot we could find with BLAST either only very closely realted
      proteins (e.g. from the same family) or very distantly related.
      What's more, with more diverged proteins manual inspection is much
      harder, and it would be very difficult to spot mistakes and improvements
      in the alignments.

      As an example, here is a blast result for the RLA3_CANAX protein:
      <div style="overflow:auto;">
      <img src="{{ url_for('static',
      filename='images/reviewer_comments/blast_rla3_canax_all.png')}}">
      </div>
      <br>
      Only the last two sequences don't belong to the same family.
      But if we have a closer look at them, we see that the match between them
      and our query protein is of very low quality.
      Here is a KMAD alignment of the whole set of 53 proteins:
      <div style="overflow:auto;">
      <img src="{{ url_for('static',
      filename='images/reviewer_comments/RLA3_CANAX_large.png')}}">

      <img src="{{ url_for('static',
      filename='images/reviewer_comments/RLA3_CANAX_legend.png')}}">
      </div>
      <br>
      Performance of KMAD on more diverged proteins is tested in the
      BAliBASE validation - out of 220 sequence sets 51 have average identity
      lower than 20%.

      In the Science 2009 article "Global Analysis of Cdk1 Substrate
      Phosphorylation Sites Provides Insights into Evolution", Holt, et al.,
      show an alignment to illustrate the low conservation of phosphorylation
      positions. While it is true, that the exact position of the
      phosphorylations is not conserved, their presence is conserved. This
      example shows exactly what KMAD was designed for: to stress conservation
      of the presence of functional sites in disordered regions where amino
      acid conservation is very low, but disorder itself and the presence of
      motifs in the region are conserved. 
      From the two presented alignments, KMAD alignment has more information
      about the actual presence of phosphorylation sites, and thus gives better
      insight into their functional importance. Actually, a phylogenetic tree
      made with RaXML from the KMAD alignment has the same shape as the tree
      given in Holt et al. So we have gained functional information at no loss
      of phylogenetic information. This is obvious because highly variable
      regions seldom contribute much to the phylogenic tree.

      Because KMAD, MUSCLE, and ClustalW don't have an option to run on multiple cores,
      we ran all methods with disabled multithreading. The multithreading
      methods would show much higher performance on a server, but it doesn't
      change much for a casual user - personal computers still usually use just
      a couple of cores.

      The tools were tested on a random sample of 22 alignments from the
      BAliBASE set.
      We present plots of the methods' runtime vs. average sequence length,
      number of sequence, and number of sequences times average sequence length
      (LxN).
      T-coffee is the slowest method in the set (it even takes longer than KMAD
      and MUSCLE when multithreading is enabled).
      KMAD is the second slowest, probably because it has more operations to
      perform with every aligned residue - check all features and calculate
      scores for them.
      In the future we plan a general optimization of the software, including  
      implementation of multithreading.

      However, the alignment part is not the bottleneck in the whole process
      for KMAD. The preparation of the sequence - that is annotation with
      information from multiple databases is much slower than the alignment
      itself. However, this doesn't depend on the creators of KMAD, but on the
      scripts maintained by the database authors (ELM and Pfam).
