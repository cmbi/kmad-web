        The reason for developing KMAD was our opinion that
        sometimes, in case of disordered (and less often, but structured as
        well) proteins plain amino acid sequence is not enough to create a
        biologically relevant sequence alignment.
        Here is a very simple example to visualize the problem that we want
        deal with (red residues are phosphoserines):
              <br>
              <strong>bad alignment:</strong>
              <br>
              <img src="{{ url_for('static',
              filename='images/bad_alignment.png')}}">
              <br>
              <strong>good alignment:</strong>
              <br>
              <img src="{{ url_for('static',
              filename='images/good_alignment.png')}}">
              <br>
              The first alignment is what all methods that don't take into
              account any other information than amino acid sequence would
              produce and in terms of the amino acid of the amino acid
              similarity it is the most optimal one.
              However, we should remember that the best alignment is the one
              that represents the biology the best, and not the one that is the
              best solution to a mathematical equation.
