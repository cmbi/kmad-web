        The reason for developing KMAD was our opinion that
        sometimes, in case of disordered (and less often, but structured as
        well) proteins plain amino acid sequence is not enough to create a
        biologically relevant sequence alignment.
        Here is a very simple example to visualize the problem that we want
        deal with (red residues are phosphoserines):
              <br>
              <br>
              <img src="{{ url_for('static',
              filename='images/bad_alignment.png')}}">
              <br>
              <br>
              <img src="{{ url_for('static',
              filename='images/good_alignment.png')}}">
              <br>
              The first alignment is what all methods that don't take into
              account any other information than amino acid sequence would
              produce. In terms of the amino acid of the amino acid
              similarity it is the optimal solution.
              However, we should remember that the best alignment is the one
              that represents the biology the best, and not the one that is the
              best solution to a mathematical equation. Hence, the alignment
              wher two phosphoserines are aligned together is in this case a
              better alignment - despite the fact that it has more gaps and
              pairiwise identity is lower.

    KMAD alignments can be used for all the usual applications of alignments,
    but it can especially help in determining the conservation of PTMs and
    motifs in very divergent (but not only) regions. Therefore, it can also be
    helpful in supporting PTM predictions.
    This example shows how bad alignment can impair our conclusions about PTM
    conservation and reliability of prediction. (This is of course a very short
    alignment, just to illustrate the general idea, normally we wouldn't draw
    any conclusions from such a short excerpt). The red residues are
    phosphoserines and orange indicates a phosphorylation prediction.
    The second alignment shows that the phosphorylation is highly conserved in
    this region, which is not clearly visible in the first alignment. The
    second alignment also shows that the phosphorylation prediction is actually
    much more reliable than what it seems from the first alignment.
